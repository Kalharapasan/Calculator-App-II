## 🧩 How It Works

- Each calculator button is connected to a **click listener** inside `MainActivity.java`.  
- The app listens for button presses, updates the display dynamically, and evaluates the expression.  
- **BigDecimal** ensures precise numeric calculations and rounding control.  
- Results are formatted with **DecimalFormat** for a clean output.  
- User history is saved with **SharedPreferences** and displayed in the UI.  
- Small **animations** and **vibration feedback** make interactions more natural.
